## DnD Spell Lookup ##

This bot does a straight search through the text of a post looking for spells.  Unfortunately this also matches with common words (like
[Slow](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Slow)).
I may end up removing very common words from the spell list.

DnD Spell Bot may be called manually with `!DnD_Spell_Bot`.  It will search the parent comment of the comment that invoked the bot for spells, then post a reply to the comment that invoked the bot.

DnD Spellbot currently uses the
[D&D 5th Edition Wikia](http://dnd5e.wikia.com/wiki/D%26D_5th_Edition_Wikia)
as its link target.
