## DnD Spell Lookup ##

This bot does a straight search through the text of a post looking for spells.  Unfortunately
this also matches with common words (like
[Slow](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Slow)).
To cut down on false positives, I made spells case sensitive.  I may end up removing
very common words from the spell list, or requiring an explicit call for these types of spells.

DnD Spellbot currently uses the
[Forgotten Realms Wiki](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)
as its link target.
